### Assignment
# Problem1
solution of circular rotation of assignment1
#Cyclic	Rotation:	Shift	the	elements	of	Multi	Value	Container	A	to	the	right	with	R	shifts	A	=	[3,	8,	9,	7,	6]	R	=	3	Output	[9,	7,	6,	3,	8]	
# Problem2
Integer	N	represents	the	number	of	candies	arranged	in	a	circle,	numbered	from	0	to	N	−	1.	You	will	eat	a	candy	and	leave	the	wrapper.	
	
You	shall	begin	eating	with	candy	number	0.	Then	you	omit	the	next	M	−	1	candy	or	wrappers	on	the	circle,	and	eat	the	following	one.	
	
More	precisely,	if	you	ate	candy	number	X,	then	you	will	next	eat	the	candy	with	number	(X	+	M)	modulo	N	(remainder	of	division).	
	
You	stop	eating	when	you	encounter	an	empty	wrapper.	
	
For	example,	given	integers	N	=	10	and	M	=	4.		You	will	eat	the	following	candy:	0,	4,	8,	2,	6.	Your	answer	should	be	5	i.e.	count	the	number	of	candy	you	ate
